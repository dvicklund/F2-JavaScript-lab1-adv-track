/* LAB 1: A Trip to Woodland Park Zoo

 Welcome to Lab 1 =)

 Be sure to read all the comments!

 All of the instructions are inline with the assignment below. Look for the
 word TODO in comments.  Each TODO will have a description of what is
 required.

 To run this file, type the following (in the terminal):

    node lab1.js

 and then press enter/return.

 Instructions for turning this lab in are in the assignment description in
 Canvas.

 I'm happy to answer any questions on Slack.

 We've implemented a function that will help you sanity-check your code.

 An assertion is something we expect to be true about the state of the
 program at the point where the assertion is made.

 Remember, state is all the variables that we've declared and their current
 values.

 Here are some examples for how to use the assert method:
*/

 above.)

 zoo-themed.  Make one pass and one fail. In the failure message, describe why
 it failed.

 TODO: 10 points (5 points each for passing jshint and jscs)
 Now, we're going to use two tools: jshint and jscs, to check our code for
 best-practices and style consistency.

 If you haven't already, run this command in the terminal (inside of this
 directory): npm install

 Now, type
  grunt
   and it will run both jshint and jscs on your code.

 Error and warning descriptions will be printed in the terminal.
 To get full points, correct all of the errors/warnings.
